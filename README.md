# RTSP-Camera-for-Android
Android based RTSP Server which is able to serve live camera view to multiple RTSP clients, such as VLC.

This project is not maintained anymore (in fact since 2end of 2012).
It exists to share the code how to implement this back in the days.

I've not tested out the following gitHub project on my own, but if you are looking for a more actual Android RTSP based solution, pls check out:
